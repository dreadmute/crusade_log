<b><span style="color:rgb(151, 219, 134);">ISKAR:</span></b> Greetings Jarak, Skadis.

<b><span style="color:rgb(234, 236, 81);">SKADIS:</span></b> Lord.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">JARAK:</span></b> Iskar. What do you know of Burhfaest?

<b><span style="color:rgb(151, 219, 134);">ISKAR:</span></b> She is oath-sworn to our shield host. I believe with our
    transition her oaths have transferred to you.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">JARAK:</span></b> I have been with the host for fifty years Iskar.
    Why has she not once taken to field?

<b><span style="color:rgb(151, 219, 134);">ISKAR:</span></b> I have not deemed it necessary.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">JARAK:</span></b> You didn't deem it necessary?

<b><span style="color:rgb(151, 219, 134);">ISKAR:</span></b> As Captain-Commander, in command of the shield host, no. I did not.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">JARAK:</span></b> Captain. Burhfaest fills a gap in our current disposition.
    We lack in ranged armaments. Even the venerable Telemon Hymfjell lacks in consistent long range pressure. We were not granted
    any significant vehicle support from the greater host to persecute the Trivilus operation, and now we find ourselves lacking.
    Why haven't you requisitioned Burhfaest?

<b><span style="color:rgb(151, 219, 134);">ISKAR:</span></b> Jarak, at no point did I deem risking her necessary to our endeavor.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">JARAK:</span></b> Our brothers have died in the front lines, engaging threats best left
    to heavier armaments.

<b><span style="color:rgb(151, 219, 134);">ISKAR:</span></b> I know.

[silence]

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">JARAK:</span></b> Tell me why I should not requisition her aid. What am I missing?

<b><span style="color:rgb(151, 219, 134);">ISKAR:</span></b> She is... volatile.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">JARAK:</span></b> What does that mean?

<b><span style="color:rgb(151, 219, 134);">ISKAR:</span></b> I would tell you if I could brother-captain. Unfortunately, I am
    sworn to silence on this matter. Her strengths, and flaws, are yours to discover for yourself. I will provide guidance where I can.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">JARAK:</span></b> Fine.
