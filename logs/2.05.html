    <b>MEHKAR-1:</b> - as amber leaves fade.
    <b>ARKIN:</b> I don't know how I feel about that one, brother.
    <b>MEHKAR-1:</b> This one has just come to me, it is fresh and needs refinement.
    <b>ARKIN:</b> Your love for the haiku structure is baffling.
    <b>MEHKAR-1:</b> It is not enough to remember the old paths, but to continue walking them.
    
    A silence falls over the vox channels.
    Mehkar tilts his head, as if hearing something.

    <b>JARAK:</b> Insertion in 5 seconds, brothers. Prepare.

    A flash of light, the feed cuts to static.

    Uraxes moves away from Jarak, his blackened bulk disappearing behind a massive water tank.

    <b>JARAK:</b> Be aware, Chaos Marines reported in area of operations. Reported daemon engines as well.
        Markings identified with Khazog's Warband.
        Brother Uraxes has already moved to cover our left flank.
        Sodality Aegian will hold the objective here at our entry point.
        Everyone else, form on me. It is unclear if this force is pursuing any key infrastructure points
        or just retreating from a previous engagement.
        Regardless, our objective is clear. We hold this water processing plant, or deny it from the enemy.
    
    Sodality Aegian draws their Sentinel blades and moves off to a burnt out building a short walk
    from the deployment zone. If it is possible for Custodes to look tense, the members of Aegian
    manage it.
    The remainder of the force begins moving through the plant.
    Champion Arkin's plume can be seen through blackened auramite, taking the lead.

    <b>ANGULIS:</b> I'm getting auspex pings through the Vexila, large target directly ahead.
        Appears to be an engine.
    <b>JARAK:</b> Distance from main control node?
    <b>ANGULIS:</b> 50 meters.
    <b>JARAK:</b> We will advance to the node and hold. Uraxes?
    <b>URAXES:</b> Yes, commander?
    <b>JARAK:</b> We have contacts, what do you see?
    <b>URAXES:</b> One engine contact as well, on a tertiary control node. I'm moving to intercept.
    <b>JARAK:</b> Heard. Contact me if you need assistance.
        Arkin, you will take the lead at the main control node. Formation Kalkas.
    <b>ARKIN:</b> Heard.

    As one, each Custodian moved to a full sprint forward, moving through the industrial piping as if it were
    nothing but smoke.
    Shots began to fly from the tangle of pipes and machinery ahead of them, punctures causing steam to explode out
    and obscure the field.
    As the force moves forward, lingering steam is atomized in a distorted wave ahead as the Defensor field of the
    Vexila pushes out it's baffling aura.

    <b>URAXES:</b> Contact.

    <b>URAXES:</b> Contact.

    Two hulking shapes move through the crumbling remains of the building.
    It is difficult to determine where the weaponry and the flesh of the astartes ends.
    As Uraxes levels his Dreadspear, the weapons retract and reform into heavier armaments.
    
    Uraxes looses great shells from the Dreadspear and spins through incoming gunfire.
    Distortion bleeds into the visual feed as the Dreadspear is expertly spun about the body
    of the ancient Achillus pattern dreadnought as strikes are interwoven with the firepower
    of the spear itself.
    One of the obliterators falls into two pieces as it's innards cook off on the power field
    of the Dreadspear blade.

    A shadow moves across the upper windows of the building, and the clank of massive
    pistons is heard as a daemon engine circles around to the entrance of the control node.

    Movement can be seen from the primary command node.
    The wide open space has provided a good vantage for the main force, while Angulis' Vexila field provides
    a needed deterrent to any ranged attacks.

    <b>ARKIN:</b> They aren't moving.
    
    Suddenly, a maulerfiend and terminator squad move from the shattered remains of an office station.
    As one, Sodality Varda throw tanglefoot grenades into the path of the terminators.
    As the machine spirits of their armor fight against them, the daemon engine lumbers forward on
    large metal hands, pushing aside any piping in it's way.

    <b>JARAK:</b> Arkin, these targets are yours. I move to aid Uraxes.

    Actinic energy begins to crawl around Jarak's Allarus plate and in a flash, he is gone, leaving nothing but
    scorchmarks on the ground where he once stood.

    <b>ARKIN:</b> Hold brothers, they will meet us on our terms.

    In the corner of the feed, an indicator flashes: "Oubliette Active".
    Arkin grasps his archeotech blade two handed, and settles into the Behemor stance.
