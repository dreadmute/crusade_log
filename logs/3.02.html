They have left.

One moment they were here, with us, directing us, giving us purpose.

Now they are gone.

They left behind that... monster. That xenos.

I can feel it, deep within the depths of the Malleatus.

Even through the black stone walls and wards they left behind, I can feel it lingering.

It is straining at the walls of it's prison.

I think it is looking for me.

By the throne, I hope the wards hold.

...

I have been directed to take us to the Cesel system by the remaining crew left.
The acting captain seems somewhat lethargic. I cannot determine if it's due to the sudden departure of our guests, or some other malady of the soul.
If they were still here, I would have passed along a report to the Shield Captain.

As we've approached the system, I can feel the turmoil in the warp.
It's waves crash against me, and I can feel in their breaking a familiar pain.
That thing in the hold feels the same, a twin to noise. To the pain.

The remaining souls, broken or otherwise, down there in the depths radiate madness and terror in equal measure.
The monster feeds on this.
If it breaks loose, at least the subjects will keep it busy.

I hope.
