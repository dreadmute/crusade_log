<b>IJ:</b> Subject 22 interrogation initiated. Mark 22.0.
    Attending Anathema Psykana squad Oblivia providing support.

<b>AP:</b><em> communicated via thoughtmark </em>

<b>22:</b> [Inaudible]

<b>IJ:</b> Subject discomfort noted. Commencing interrogation.

<b>IJ:</b> Do you know where you are?

<b>22:</b> [Inaudible]
           [Subject has vomited]

<b>IJ:</b> Do you know where you are?

<b>22:</b> No, why is it so quiet?

<b>IJ:</b> Can you please describe what you see?

<b>22:</b> Do you know who I am? I am Senior ██████████████████.

<b>IJ:</b> Can you please describe what you see?

<b>22:</b> You Custodes are supposed to serve the imperium, why are you holding me illegally?

<b>IJ:</b> We serve the Emperor, not the Imperium.
           Can you please describe what you see?

<b>22:</b> I am a sanctioned psyker, once these Sisters step away I will do
           whatever I have to to escape this.

<b>IJ:</b> Can you please describe what you see?

<b>22:</b> Fine. We are in a large empty room. It is dark. I am surrounded by... pariahs.

<b>IJ:</b> Continue.

<b>22:</b> I am sitting at a table with you, a black armored warrior of the Custodes.
           It is cold.

<b>IJ:</b> 2 paces.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>22:</b> Why are they stepping back?

<b>IJ:</b> Mark 22.7. Baseline established. Beginning probe.

<b>22:</b> You must know the further they step away, the more... free I become.

<b>22:</b> Why are you doing this?

<b>IJ:</b> Context: the Trivilus system collapsed 2 terran standard days ago.
           It has taken us into an... undefined pocket of reality.
           We still have a task to accomplish, and we intend to do so.
           That task concerns the Tyranid Hive Fleet, Designation Myrkr.

<b>IJ:</b> What do you know of this hive fleet?
           What is its current temperament?

<b>22:</b> Trivilus collapsed?! What happened?
           
<b>IJ:</b> What is the current temperatment of Myrkr?

<b>22:</b> How would I know that?

<b>IJ:</b> 4 paces.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>22:</b> Why do they keep stepping back?

<b>IJ:</b> What is the current temperatment of Myrkr?

<b>22:</b> I do not understand how I'm supposed to know the answer to that question.

<b>IJ:</b> What is the current temperatment of Myrkr?

<b>22:</b> I will flay you alive.
           [groan]

<b>IJ:</b> Describe what you just attempted.

<b>22:</b> I can begin to feel the power returning... it is too muted.
           [groan]

<b>IJ:</b> 5 paces.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>IJ:</b> It is not too soon. 5 paces.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>22:</b> What were-
           I can feel it!

<b>IJ:</b> What is the current temperatment of Myrkr?

<b>22:</b> Die you -!
           [screams]
           The hunger! The rage!
           It is infinite!

<b>IJ:</b> Good. Mark 22.32. Contact established with Myrkr.

<b>IJ:</b> Focus and we will ease the pain.
           What do you see?

<b>22:</b> [screams]

<b>22:</b> [screams]

<b>IJ:</b> 3 paces back.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>22:</b> [sigh]

<b>IJ:</b> What did you see? Look past the pain.

<b>22:</b> You're a bastard.
           No no no! Put your hand down, keep them here.
           I never thought I would welcome the presence of a pariah.

<b>IJ:</b> What did you see?

<b>22:</b> There are three... overminds present.
           Vast presences.
           Two of them are what I believe to be these "Hive Fleets".
           The other is massive but lingering.
           It causes no pain.

<b>22:</b> The Hive Minds are -
           [Subject has vomited again]

<b>IJ:</b> Continue.

<b>22:</b> The one that is closest.
           It is... angry.
           It is too alien to allocate human emotions to, you understand?
           But this is the most I can gather.

<b>IJ:</b> Did you detect any distinct minds within the fleet?

<b>22:</b> Possibly?
           There is a lynchpin that this hive follows.
           It seems almost like an individual.
           
           It does not like this place.

<b>IJ:</b> This is likely the Tyrant.
           Any others?

<b>22:</b> I couldn't tell!
           You have thrown me into the ocean and asked me to find a single drop?
           This is madness.

<b>IJ:</b> This is our only option.

<b>22:</b> And how many other psykers have you used to get this information?

<b>IJ:</b> Did you see any other minds?

<b>22:</b> How many of us have you used?!

<b>IJ:</b> Did you see any other minds?

<b>22:</b> [yelling]

<b>IJ:</b> Mark 22.51. Subject is no longer coherent.
           Attempt direct contact.

<b>22:</b> [yelling]

<b>IJ:</b> 20 paces. Standby for intervention and purge.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>IJ:</b> Your discomfort is noted. Proceed.

<b>22:</b> [yelling]
           [additional voices noted]

<b>IJ:</b> Mark 22.56. Subject has established contact.

<b>22:</b> We... HUNGER... cor... corrr... ruption
           Consume... corruption...
           See... you...
           Prey
           [screaming]

<b>IJ:</b> Subject is under acute stress.

<b>22:</b> Prey
           [screaming]

<b>IJ:</b> Subject is under acute stress.
           Standby for purge.

<b>22:</b> [screaming]
           Consume! Devour!
           [screaming]

<b>IJ:</b> Purge.

<b>22:</b> [burning]
           PREY
           [screaming]

<b>IJ:</b> Mark 22.66. Mortis achieved.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>IJ:</b> Yes, there was improvement.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>IJ:</b> I do not believe we moved too quickly.
           The abrupt changes seems to provide enough context within the mind
           of the subject to translate the vast impulses of the Hive Mind into
           standard Gothic equivalents.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>IJ:</b> This one did last the longest so far.
           For the next we will use a briefed volunteer.
           This may provide better results.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>IJ:</b> Yes, I will retrieve the MSU and record any findings in the ancilliary files.
           They will be made available soon.

<b>AP:</b><em> thoughtmark </em>

<b>IJ:</b> Thank you for your service Sister.

<b>IJ:</b> Prepare the next subject.
