<i>I was called on to attend to the debrief in the Armamentarium following the initial boarding engagements.
    I was to ascertain the current disposition of Brokkgaldr's ongoing repair requests from head priest 65-Krol.
    Recording begins shortly, what I assume to be, before the arrival of Lord Arkin.
</i>

<b><span style="color:rgb(234, 236, 81);">SKADIS:</span></b> Adept, you know whose authority I am here by.
    Please provide me with the current status of any ongoing repair requests for the recent sorties by Lord
    Arkin and his forces.

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Irritation: I have stated before, material analysis
    on armor provided for repair is relegated to an authority grade higher than you-

<b><span style="color:rgb(234, 236, 81);">SKADIS:</span></b> And as I have stated, I am here on his authority.
    That supersedes any authority grade that might be required.

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Persistent: Nevertheless, scribe, I cannot provide
    the requested data without the proper exchange codes.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">ARKIN:</span></b> Enough. Adept 65-Krol, provide scribe Skadis with the
    requested data. My ident authority code has been exchanged.

<i> I do not know when Arkin entered the chamber. In fact, I do not recall any moment when I have seen Arkin move from
    any place on the ship to another. He is simply... there.
    I will query some of the engineers I am familiar with if I can get logs on hatchway operations.
</i>

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Apologetic: Of course, honored servant of the Omnissiah.
    Follow me.

<i> Adept 65-Krol takes us back into the Armamentarium proper. There are many suits of decoupled auramite suspended over
    workbenches. I also see some of the Anathema Psykana armor over some workbenches. The damage inflicted is... extensive.
</i>

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Standard: My lord, we have performed material analysis on all
    submitted armor. Results show contact with 3 classifications of combatant.
    Heavy Ion scarring, especially on the armor of Sodality Aegian, indicates contact with xenos designate: T'au.
    Imperial grade steel shavings and low build up of organic mycelium indicate contact with xenos designate: Orks.
    Final categorization is... unknown.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">ARKIN:</span></b> We do not operate in unknowns, Adept. Speak plainly.

<i> I do not believe I have seen an adept of the Mechanicum look uncomfortable before. I would take a small guilty joy in the
    fact if I did not also recall the chill I felt at the time.
</i>

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Speculative: My lord, the rents found in your force's armor, 
    especially yours, appear almost as organic wounds. Each cut shows sign of organic corruption that we would expect to see after
    forceful removal of organic matter. I am considering querying a fellow Adept Biologis to-

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">ARKIN:</span></b> That will not be necessary. I realize now that you were not with
    our Host during the ████████████ Operation. I have now transmitted the requisite reports that should provide... enlightenment.

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Apologetic: My lord, the data shown here is impossible.

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">ARKIN:</span></b> It is not, and it will factor in properly with all necessary repairs.

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Insistent: My lord, the data here does not align with known material
    realities, we cannot-

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">ARKIN:</span></b> You can. You will.

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Acceptance: Acknowledged, lord. How do we categorize this?

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">ARKIN:</span></b> Daemon will do, adept.

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Statement: We are able to cross-reference previous reports here 
    abroad to this categorization. Query: The damage to your armor, my lord, is particularly extensive. It will take a significant
    effort to properly formulate-

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">ARKIN:</span></b> That will not be necessary. If all other repairs have been performed,
    I can handle the rest.

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Interrogative: My lord-

<b><span style="color:rgb(136, 136, 243);">ARKIN:</span></b> Enough, Adept. Have it sent to my arming chambers.

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Obedient: Of course, immediately, my lord.

<b><span style="color:rgb(234, 236, 81);">SKADIS:</span></b> Adept, can you please provide me with the requested
    reports so I can bring them to Shield Captain Jarak can review.

<b><span style="color:rgb(230, 18, 18);">65-KROL:</span></b> Standard: transferring to your slate now. Please remove yourself
    from my armamentarium.

<b><span style="color:rgb(234, 236, 81);">SKADIS:</span></b> Yes, my lord. Lord Arkin, may I-

<i> I was in the process of requesting additional details regarding the boarding operations that Arkin had led on the
    way back to the host chambers, but he had already gone when I turned to him.
