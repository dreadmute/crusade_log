<b><span style="color:rgb(23, 216, 55);">CONDITION</span></b>

Our Eyes in the Ultra Vernor Expanse report a high concentration of enemy vessels of all designations.
Multiple near orbit entities may require ship to ship actions.
As a result, force organization should be planned for both close quarters surgical actions and larger scale
traditional field operations.

<b><span style="color:rgb(23, 216, 55);">DISPOSITION</span></b>

<b><span style="color:rgb(211, 29, 211);">++ UNIT REPORT REQUISITION:// ARKIN  ++</span></b>
Arkin is our most capable swordsman. I have known him for nearly two centuries, and have only known him
to improve in his skill. With the transfer of tactical command to myself, I plan to rely on his skill
moreso than in the Trivilus incident.
Yes, Skadis. I know how you and your fellow Attendants refer to him. I will speak to it here.
He is referred to as "The Night Man". This epithet is a reference to an ancient Terran performance by
the dramaturge Charles Daiysen, wherein a warrior of great skill vanquishes the "Lord of Light". From the
surviving fragments of the transcript, we have identified some rudimentary proto versions of our own
Ka'tahs. 
It is my understanding that the larger Shadowkeepers Shield Host's investment of the Oubliette with him
is what brought about the name "Night Man", is that correct? Understood.
No, while I don't necessarily agree with my brothers and myself having unoffical titles, it is relevant
to address how other members of the host refer to us.

<b><span style="color:rgb(24, 199, 230);">++ CHAMBER ACCESS:// THARANATOI  ++</span></b>

<b><span style="color:rgb(211, 29, 211);">++ UNIT REPORT REQUISITION:// ANGULIS  ++</span></b>
Angulis is the newest member of the Tharanatoi within our Host. He continues to carry our Vexila but now is gilded
in our Allarus plate. Given our tendency in engagements to close with our enemy more than intended, I understood his
desire to transistion to our chamber. I have chosen to provide him with Obliteratum. I expect him to remain 
a presence in our engagements, for both his brothers and the enemy.

<b><span style="color:rgb(211, 29, 211);">++ UNIT REPORT REQUISITION:// SODALITY VAHN ++</span></b>
Vahn is one of my closest brothers and demonstrates great skill with the Castellan Axe. He has requisitioned an
additional member to his unit and I've received promision reports of his mentorship. With my recent elevation, I trust
him to represent the Tharanatoi chamber for our host well.
I have already discussed with him his role in the upcoming campaign and expect him to be the hammer to our anvil.
Together with Mekhar, we have already begun configuring the Veilbreaker Teleportarium aboard the Malleatus for both
near orbit boarding actions and planetstrike operations.

<b><span style="color:rgb(211, 29, 211);">++ UNIT REPORT REQUISITION:// SODALITY MEKHAR ++</span></b>
I did not believe my former mentor would approve a requisition of his sodality, but here we are.
I have not spoken with him since the ███████████████ Operation three centuries ago, but I recall us parting on good terms.
His skill with the spear is legendary, and rumors circulated that he had trained with Valdor himself.
The manifest shows that he brought a stasis chamber as well. If it is what I believe it to be, then I will have 
much to prove over the course of this campaign.

<b><span style="color:rgb(24, 199, 230);">++ CHAMBER ACCESS:// WARDENS  ++</span></b>

<b><span style="color:rgb(211, 29, 211);">++ UNIT REPORT REQUISITION:// SODALITY VARDA  ++</span></b>
Of the failures of the Triviuls campaign, the underutilization of the Warden Chamber is one I would rank high.
Varda has time and time again proven his Sodality's prowess in the field and has provided both Iskar and myself
with unparalleled protection. His skill as a former campanion is evident in his record.
I have received reports that a former member of his Sodality has petitioned to form an additional Sodality of
Wardens as well. I will do what I can to help the formulation of this Sodality to help in this campaign.
I look forward to taking to the field with his Axes at our side.

<b><span style="color:rgb(24, 199, 230);">++ CHAMBER ACCESS:// HYKANATOI  ++</span></b>

<b><span style="color:rgb(211, 29, 211);">++ UNIT REPORT REQUISITION:// SODALITY AEGIAN  ++</span></b>
I know you and your fellow attendants discuss the "rift" between myself and Iskar.
The rift is non-existant. We move forward with singular and unwavering purpose.
My requisition of the Aegian Sodality from the Hykanatoi is for their unique skill in close quarters combat,
a skill I believe we will benefit greatly from during the projected boarding actions. 
I have spoken only a few times with Aegian and have found him to be agreeable, if not a little morose.
If he finds issue with the change in command, I expect him to speak to me plainly about it.

<b><span style="color:rgb(24, 199, 230);">++ CADRE ACCESS:// HYLJODIS ++</span></b>

<b><span style="color:rgb(211, 29, 211);">++ UNIT REPORT REQUISITION:// SQUAD OBLIVIA  ++</span></b>
I have petitioned and once again Oblivia has answered the call. Her sisters of the Vigil were instrumental during our
reconnaissance operations and interrogations during the Trivilus incident, and I expect them to do great work in the
field with our brothers. Our history spans many centuries and I plan to continue our traditions.


<b><span style="color:rgb(23, 216, 55);">ANALYSIS</span></b>

This will be my first major campaign as Captain Commander. I have attempted to requisition and organize our forces
to the best of my abililty to suit the projected threats we will face on Perpilor.
The need to organize our forces to both encompass a surgical boarding actions force and a full deployment is a 
unique challenge. I hope that our host will live up to the task.
I am currently petitioning additional Sodalities within our host for future operations.
I have already sent missives to the Moritoi Chamber contingent aboard Malleatus to prepare for larger scale engagements
in the campaign.
I have high expectations for our Host. I know they have high expectations for me as well.
The unusual transfer of leadership hangs over me like the fabled Sword of Damoclician.
While I am confident in my ability to lead the host, I cannot ignore the burden that such a position requires.
We will not be found wanting.
