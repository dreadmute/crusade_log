This place remains strange, captain.

We have designated each of the floating land masses as "World Shards", since they appear to be self contained 
remnants of worlds from both the Trivilus system and beyond.

Through what appears to be warp sorcery each of these Shards appears to have retained its full atmosphere, 
fauna, and other characteristics of fully intact worlds. However, the entire realm lacks the usual stench
and ozone charge of the warp, instead appearing to be an interstitial zone of reality.

Most of this I am sure you already know from other reports but I record here for the sake of protocol.

Myrkr's intent is hard to discern once again, but from what we can gather the fleet is attempting to
siphon biomass from each of these World Shards back to their core fleet to reconstitute the losses
they sustained after the Trivilus incident.

We have been unable to determine if the adaptation from what we have typically identified as Hive Fleet Leviathan
to what we believe to be a strain of Gorgon was caused by the initial breach into this interstitial zone. This 
may be more a question for the Magos Biologis, but I posit a few theories we have entertained here:
- A necessary adaptation to this new environment?
- Proximity to another hive fleet of a different tendril?

We have never known the tyranid to act without intent which makes this concern a high priority to ascertain. Ultimately
the fleet seems unphased by the transition to this interstitial zone and appears to have a limited connection to the 
greater hive mind or is able to generate a localized enough concentration of leader beasts to maintain cohesion. Also
worth noting is that the fleet does not appear to be influenced by the other hive fleet within the zone. We estimate
the fleets will make contact within the next cycle.

Regarding World Shard: WS.YHP-724, we were originally drawn towards this shard pursuing Myrkr.

As they began their biomass harvesting it appears they aggravated a local Drukkhari raiding group that must have
been pulled in during the breach. This World Shard appears to have once been an old Imperial Industrial world and 
somehow, beyond belief, some of the local citizens survived the transition. Observing these citizens initially brought
on a sense of unease uncharacterstic to our kind, but the initial feeling would not become clear until later. We can 
only conclude that the raiding group must have been hunting for live targets as well, though for more... depraved means.

The xenos engaged each other and tore through most of the remaining ruins. It appears that, while a close battle, the 
hive fleet fell to the raiding party. This victory was obtained at great cost it appears, as the tyranids were able to
siphon off significant biomass from the enemy and world shard in the process. 

What was curious is what occurred next. Only through careful review of our auspex readings and meditation to re-orient
my mind was I able to discern what had occurred. 

It appears that this world shard is under a temporal loop. Shortly after their initial engagement, it appears that everything
had reset to it's initial state. Citizens previously abducted or consumed were returned, ruins were rebuilt, and any signs of
battle erased.

Both xenos forces then engaged in the same conflict. What is curious about this is that each force clearly had grown or
retained scars from the previous engagement, just did not appear to have any recollection that they had fought before. The 
composition of each force had varied slightly between egagements, but not in any significant way to indicate that either
force retained previous knowledge of their prior engagement.

The fleet was victorious in the second bout and appeared to be attempting to terraform the world shard with a Parasite organism.
The raiding party seemed focused on desecrating key points across the battlefield, which at first appeared to have no effect, but
once the leader organisms were brought down turned out to have a detrimental effect on the lesser organisms. I wouldn't categorize
it as fear as such, but rather some sort of psychic dampening similar to our Anathema Psykana cohorts. This in conjunction
with a lack of synaptic oversight appeared to be enough to further deteriorate the temperament of the lesser organisms.

After both xenos forces left the world shard, everything returned to its prior state. It is difficult to report on this shard
without great concentration due to an insistence in my mind that the world shard was always in that state. Each time I look upon
these ruins and the few survivors within it my mind is in conflict trying to reconcile the reality that this place was ravaged.

A primary concern regarding WS.YHP-274 and these specific xenos forces is that with it's ability to reset yet still provide 
resources to both xenos forces, this could be used by either as an endless battery of sorts, providing each enemy force
with critical strategic gains without losing anything substantial in the process. However, given the nature of this shard to 
alter the temporal perceptions of any who observe it I do not think that any attempt to exploit this anomoly in this manner
will arise deliberately. If there is any indication of a deliberate intent to do so, I fear we must respond in order to prevent
it.

Regarding target ██████████████████████████, we have still not acquired visual confirmation that it is active within this
theatre of operations. From our original mandate and observations prior to the Trivilus incident, we know it usually is in
a ███████████████ role. So far, we have only been able to identify the leader organism designation: Hilmir as the primary
organism in any engagement.

I would advise attempting to discern the reason for this using your... method.
While effective to a degree, I do not believe it to be the best ---
